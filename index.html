        <h2>About me</h2>
          <p id="aboutMeText"> Hello! My name is Joe Pennock. I am 32 years old and I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, the most beautiful place on earth! I've been married for 5 years now to my lovely wife Meghan. We don't have kids yet, though that will probably start to change here in the near future. I have a dog named Sawyer who is the best boy. He can be a little mischievous sometimes, but I still manage to love him anyway. I'm currently enrolled at Code Fellows on the path to becoming a master code wizard.</p>

        <h2>My Goals for the Future</h2>
          <p id="goalsText"> My immediate goal for the future is to finish the Code 201 course at Code Fellows. My plan is to go on to complete their Code 301 and then eventually their Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Python course. once I finish school, I would love to work at a local startup and get some real world experience in the tech industry. Once I have a little work experience under my belt, I want to pursue jobs more in the AI/ML field. I love the possibilities presented by the advances in AI. I also have an interest in augmented and virtual reality technologies. I would love to play even a small role in the development of a working full-dive virtual reality environment.</p>
